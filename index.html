    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      With a B.S. in Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology from NC State, I bring a unique blend of education, experience, and passion for environmental stewardship. My journey includes roles at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences, a summer working at NASA Langley as part of the DEVELOP program, as an English instructor in South Korea, followed by 5 years of hands-on work as an Environmental Park Technician with Wake County Parks, Recreation, and Open Space. I thrive on solving complex environmental challenges and am dedicated to sustainable resource management and wildlife conservation. As an Eagle Scout, I value teamwork, community engagement, and making a lasting, positive impact on the environment.

    <p>
      In my free time I enjoy being active, cooking, traveling, learning Mandarin, playing games with friends, and getting into new hobbies!

        <h3>Natural Resources Management</h3>
        <p>
          Over the past five years, I‚Äôve led a variety of conservation projects, including monitoring and maintaining wood duck, bluebird, and brown-headed nuthatch nest boxes, wildlife monitoring via trail cameras, cover boards, and frog pipes, and participating in the Box Turtle Connection project. I‚Äôve coordinated eagle nest observations, invasive species removal, litter cleanup days, water quality sampling, aquatic turtle trapping, and native plant restoration ‚Äî all with the goal of protecting natural resources and ensuring safe, healthy spaces for both wildlife and the community.
